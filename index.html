      <h1>Do You Have A Website?</h1>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/cnk/">Cynthia Kiser,</a>
        <a href="mailto:cnk@caltech.edu">cnk@caltech.edu</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>Outline</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>Do you need a website?</li>
        <li>What is the purpose of your website?</li>
        <li>What should your site say?</li>
        <li>How to build your site using Caltech Sites</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>Do you need a website?</h1>

      <p>Maybe.  (probably). But what about alternatives?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>LinkedIn</li>
        <li>Specific networking sites,
          e.g. <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Those sites have eyeballs (good) but they do not pull together
        everything about you and / or let you showcase your story the
        way you want to tell it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>What is the purpose of your website?</h1>

      <p>
        That depends on your goals.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Get an academic job</li>
        <li>Get an industry job</li>
        <li>Teach / outreach</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Before you start building your site, think about your audience(s). Are you writing for present and future collegues? Do you also want to write for a more general audience? kids? policy makers? your family?
      </p>

      <p>
        Personal stuff probably belongs somewhere else: a personal web site or a collection of Instagram, Facebook, etc. pages.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>What should your site say?</h1>

      <p>
        Look at examples of people who are where you want to be - and emulate them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Start basic: What is your current research? And why should we care about it? + contact information
      </p>

      <p>
        Time permitting add to this. What previous research experience have you had? and how has that contributed to your future research direction?
      </p>

      <p>
        Optional extras: 
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Videos of you speaking</li>
        <li>Speaker slide decks (careful republication embargos)</li>
        <li>Blog</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
